# TicTacToe

This is a project from a month or two ago that I've decided to publish on GitHub for others to see. It's very basic, and it's console based. It currently has two different gametypes, one being "2PLAYER" which allows two human players to play and the other being "AI" allowing a single human player to play against a very simple AI opponent.

TO-DO:
  - Error Handling
  - Input Validation
  - Startup Instructions
  - Smarter AI
  - Visuals using WPF
